# Weather-Forecasting
The activities of many primary sectors depend on the weather for production, e.g.farming. The climate is changing at a drastic rate nowadays, which makes the old weather prediction methods less effective and more hectic. To overcome these difficulties, the improved and reliable weather prediction methods are required. These predictions affect a nation's economy and the lives of people. To develop a  weather forecasting system that can be used in remote areas is the main motivation of this work. The data analytics and machine learning algorithms, such as random forest classification, are used to predict weather conditions Weather forecasting can be done by “Using Linear Regression” or “Neural Network models” and many more. The main aim of this project is to implement a weather forecasting technique which is a low-cost and portable solution using “LinearRegression” model.
